- Hi, I’m @jmrox2001
- I’m interested in ... Technology Repair, PC building, and Console Emulation
- I’m currently learning ... Python(1 Week In)
- I have "made" a few programs with ChatGPT that I may post. They will all be marked with "-ChatGPT" 
- All other programs are made by me, possibly with minor input by ChatGPT(spacing/readability).
- Enjoy! Or don't, idk.
