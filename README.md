- Hi, I’m @jmrox2001
- 🛠️ I’m interested in technology repair, PC building, and console emulation.
- 🐍 I’m currently learning Python (1 Week In).
- 🤖 I have "made" a few programs with ChatGPT that I may post. They will all be marked with "-ChatGPT".
- 🧠 All other programs are made by me, possibly with minor input by ChatGPT (spacing/readability).
- Enjoy! Or don't, idk.
